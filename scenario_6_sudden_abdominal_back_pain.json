{"case_id":"scenario_6_sudden_abdominal_back_pain","title":"Scenario 6: Vascular Surgery","diagnosis_topic":"Sudden Onset Severe Abdominal and Back Pain","setup_script":"A 72-year-old male smoker with hypertension and COPD presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe abdominal and back pain that began 2 hours ago. He describes the pain as 'tearing' and the worst pain he's ever felt. Vital signs show: BP 85/50 (right arm), 90/55 (left arm), HR 124, RR 24, O2 saturation 92% on room air. On examination, he appears diaphoretic and in obvious distress. His abdomen is diffusely tender with a palpable, pulsatile mass. Femoral pulses are weak bilaterally. Initial labs show: Hgb 9.8 g/dL, WBC 14,200/Î¼L, creatinine 1.7 mg/dL, lactate 3.8 mmol/L. How would you proceed with this patient?","dynamic_flow":[{"trigger":"If resident initiates resuscitation","reply":"You start large-bore IV access and begin fluid resuscitation. The patient's BP temporarily improves to 95/60 but then drops again. What specific imaging would you order, if any?"},{"trigger":"If resident requests CT angiogram","reply":"The CT shows a 7.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with active extravasation and a large retroperitoneal hematoma. What is your next step?"},{"trigger":"If resident delays intervention to obtain more imaging","reply":"While awaiting further studies, the patient becomes more hypotensive (BP 70/40) and increasingly agitated. How does this change your management?"},{"trigger":"If resident calls for immediate operative intervention","reply":"What specific approach would you use for this ruptured AAA? Open or endovascular?"},{"trigger":"If resident chooses open repair","reply":"Describe your approach to proximal and distal control and the technical steps of the repair."},{"trigger":"If resident chooses EVAR","reply":"What anatomic factors would you need to consider for endovascular repair, and what are the relative advantages and disadvantages in this unstable patient?"},{"trigger":"If resident does not address critical care considerations","reply":"After successful repair, the patient develops progressive oliguria and hypoxemia in the ICU. What complications are you concerned about, and how would you manage them?"},{"trigger":"If resident does not discuss abdominal compartment syndrome","reply":"The patient has increasing ventilator requirements, peak airway pressures are rising, and bladder pressure is measured at 28 mmHg.
