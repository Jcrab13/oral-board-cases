{"case_id":"scenario_9_right_lower_quadrant_pain","title":"Scenario 9: Acute Appendicitis (General Surgery)","diagnosis_topic":"Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain","setup_script":"A 22-year-old previously healthy female presents to the emergency department with right lower quadrant abdominal pain that began periumbilically 24 hours ago. She reports anorexia, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. She denies urinary symptoms or vaginal discharge. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Vital signs show: Temperature 38.1°C, HR 98, BP 124/76, RR 18. On examination, she has tenderness at McBurney's point with voluntary guarding. Initial labs show: WBC 13,500/μL with left shift, urinalysis normal, and pregnancy test negative.
