{"case_id":"scenario_2_blunt_abdominal_trauma","title":"Scenario 2: Trauma","diagnosis_topic":"Blunt Abdominal Trauma with Hemodynamic Changes","setup_script":"A 28-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision where she was the restrained driver. She was traveling approximately 45 mph when she was T-boned on the driver's side. On arrival, she is alert and oriented but complaining of left upper quadrant pain and left shoulder pain. Vital signs are: BP 110/70, HR 105, RR 20, O2 saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals seat belt sign across the chest and abdomen, and tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant with voluntary guarding. Initial labs show: Hgb 11.2 g/dL, WBC 14,500/μL, platelets 230,000/μL, and normal coagulation studies. How would you proceed with this patient?","dynamic_flow":[{"trigger":"If resident asks for additional history","reply":"Patient was extricated by EMS, no loss of consciousness, complains of increasing abdominal pain, and has no significant past medical history."},{"trigger":"If resident requests FAST exam","reply":"FAST exam shows free fluid in the left upper quadrant and in the pelvis."},{"trigger":"If resident requests CT scan","reply":"CT scan shows a grade III splenic laceration with moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen. No other solid organ injuries are identified."},{"trigger":"If resident initiates resuscitation and proposes non-operative management","reply":"You admit the patient to the ICU for monitoring. Six hours later, the patient becomes more tachycardic (HR 125) and blood pressure drops to 90/60. Repeat Hgb is 8.5 g/dL. What now?"},{"trigger":"If resident proposes angioembolization","reply":"Interventional radiology is consulted but will take 1 hour to mobilize. The patient continues to be tachycardic with marginally improving BP despite fluid resuscitation. What's your next step?"},{"trigger":"If resident decides on operative management","reply":"You take the patient to the operating room. On exploration, you find a significantly shattered spleen with active bleeding. What is your operative plan now?"},{"trigger":"If resident describes splenectomy","reply":"You successfully perform a splenectomy. The patient stabilizes. What specific postoperative considerations does this young patient require?"},{"trigger":"If resident does not address post-splenectomy vaccination","reply":"The patient recovers well but 1 year later develops severe pneumococcal pneumonia.
