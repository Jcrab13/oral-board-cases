You initiated appropriate antibiotics and considered source control options. Communication of your management plan was clear and structured.. Areas for improvement include At times, escalation of care decisions were delayed. Continued work is needed in balancing access salvage with eradication of infection and arranging alternate dialysis access in a timely manner. More detail in operative planning and technical description would strengthen performance..
