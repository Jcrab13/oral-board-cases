  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by promptly recognizing Barrett\u2019s esophagus with high-grade dysplasia and appropriately considering both endoscopic and surgical management. Your operative description of esophagectomy was structured and complete.Areas for Improvement:Strengthen your management approach by explicitly addressing surveillance schedules and the role of acid suppression after therapy. Be more detailed in describing technical steps and perioperative considerations for esophagectomy.Suggested Reading:- SCORE: Barrett\u2019s Esophagus and Esophageal Dysplasia- ASE Core Curriculum: Esophagectomy \u2013 operative approaches and outcomes- NCCN Guidelines: Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers"
