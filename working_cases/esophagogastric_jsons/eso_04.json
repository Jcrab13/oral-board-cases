  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by promptly ordering endoscopy and staging studies. Your understanding of multimodal therapy and surgical planning was well structured, and you clearly articulated operative steps and potential complications.Areas for Improvement:Further detail in describing management of postoperative complications, particularly handling of anastomotic leaks and nutritional support, would strengthen your performance. Greater emphasis on discussing surveillance protocols and survivorship considerations would also be beneficial.Suggested Reading:- SCORE Curriculum: Esophageal Cancer- NCCN Guidelines: Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers- Review: Operative Techniques in Esophagectomy"
