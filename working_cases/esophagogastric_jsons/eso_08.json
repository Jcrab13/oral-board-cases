  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the upper GI bleed and appropriately prioritizing resuscitation and endoscopy. Your communication of the management plan was structured and clear.Areas for Improvement:Earlier recognition of the risks of rebleeding and escalation to interventional or operative management could improve timeliness of care. Greater emphasis on long-term strategies, including H. pylori eradication and strict NSAID avoidance, is recommended.Suggested Reading Topics:- SCORE: Management of Upper GI Bleeding- ACS/ASE Review Manual: Peptic Ulcer Disease and Complications- Endoscopic and Surgical Management of Nonvariceal Hemorrhage"
