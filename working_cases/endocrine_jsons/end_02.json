  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing features of hypercortisolism and pursuing confirmatory testing. Your clinical judgment in planning transsphenoidal surgery was timely and well-structured. Communication with the multidisciplinary team was clear and professional.Areas for Improvement: Earlier discussion of alternative etiologies of ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome would strengthen your differential. Consider refining your approach to postoperative endocrine complications and long-term surveillance strategies.Suggested Reading: - SCORE Curriculum: Pituitary Disorders and Hypercortisolism - ACS/ASE Review: Perioperative Endocrine Management - Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cushing Syndrome"
