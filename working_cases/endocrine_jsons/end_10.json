  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by identifying hyperthyroidism refractory to medical therapy and articulating the indications for surgery. Your preoperative optimization and explanation of risks were clear and structured.Areas for Improvement: Be more detailed in describing the technical steps of thyroidectomy, particularly preservation of parathyroid glands and recurrent laryngeal nerves. Clarify your discussion of postoperative monitoring and long-term follow-up.Suggested Reading Topics: - ATA Guidelines on the Management of Hyperthyroidism and Graves Disease - Surgical Anatomy and Technique of Total Thyroidectomy - Management of Thyroid Storm and Postoperative Hypocalcemia"
