  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated solid diagnostic reasoning by identifying suspicious ultrasound features and appropriately ordering FNA. Your operative planning reflected understanding of nodal disease, and you communicated surgical risks effectively. You described the operative steps in a logical and structured manner.Areas for Improvement: Further refinement is needed in outlining technical nuances of the operation and postoperative calcium management. Be more precise in discussing adjuvant therapy options and long-term surveillance.Suggested Reading Topics: - ATA Guidelines on Management of Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer - Surgical Anatomy and Technical Steps of Thyroidectomy with Central Neck Dissection - Management of Post-Thyroidectomy Hypocalcemia and Hypoparathyroidism"
