  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by considering a comprehensive hormonal evaluation. Your communication regarding operative versus non-operative management was structured and clear.Areas for Improvement: Earlier recognition of the significance of imaging features and their role in operative decision-making would strengthen your clinical judgment. Further refinement in perioperative steroid management is recommended.Suggested Reading Topics: - Evaluation and management of adrenal incidentalomas (SCORE) - Surgical approaches to adrenal tumors (ACS/ASE Core Curriculum) - Perioperative management of steroid-dependent patients (Endocrine Society Guidelines)"
