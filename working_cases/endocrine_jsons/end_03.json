  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing Whipple\u2019s triad and ordering confirmatory testing. Your operative planning showed solid knowledge of surgical options and you articulated your management plan clearly.Areas for Improvement: Earlier discussion of preoperative glucose management and detailed planning for pancreatic fistula prevention would strengthen your approach. Refinement in addressing postoperative complications such as pancreatic leak is recommended.Suggested Reading Topics: - SCORE Curriculum: Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors - ACS/ASE Review Manual: Management of Insulinoma - Perioperative Management of Pancreatic Surgery"
