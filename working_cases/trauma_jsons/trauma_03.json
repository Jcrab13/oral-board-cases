  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated sound diagnostic reasoning by appropriately recognizing blunt hepatic injury and selecting nonoperative management for a stable patient. Your communication was clear and structured, and you appropriately considered patient safety and injury prevention.\nAreas for Improvement: Earlier discussion of monitoring for delayed hemorrhage and explicit planning for follow-up imaging would strengthen your management approach. Consider refining your explanation of the criteria for nonoperative versus operative intervention.\nSuggested Reading Topics: - Management of Hepatic Trauma (SCORE) - EAST Practice Guidelines for Nonoperative Management of Blunt Hepatic Injuries - Complications after Liver Trauma and Their Management (ACS/ASE Review Manual)"
