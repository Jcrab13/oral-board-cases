You managed resuscitation appropriately and escalated care to surgical intervention without unnecessary delay.\nAreas for ImprovementWork on refining assessment of wound trajectory and intraoperative management steps, particularly when injuries involve pulmonary or cardiac structures. Further development of postoperative planning and complication anticipation will strengthen your performance.\nSuggested Reading Topics- Indications and techniques for Emergency Department Thoracotomy (SCORE)- Management of Penetrating Thoracic Trauma (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Postoperative complications of thoracic trauma (retained hemothorax, empyema, ARDS)"
