She was traveling approximately 45 mph when she was T-boned on the driver's side. On arrival, she is alert and oriented but complaining of left upper quadrant pain and left shoulder pain. Vital signs are: BP 110/70, HR 105, RR 20, O2 saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals seat belt sign across the chest and abdomen, and tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant with voluntary guarding. Initial labs show: Hgb 11.2 g/dL, WBC 14,500/\u03bcL, platelets 230,000/\u03bcL, and normal coagulation studies. How would you proceed with this patient?\"",
