  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by identifying Meckel\u2019s diverticulum as a likely source of painless GI bleeding. You appropriately ordered confirmatory testing and coordinated operative management. Communication with the team and family was clear and structured.Areas for Improvement:Earlier recognition of the hemodynamic instability and timely transfusion planning could be improved. Consider broadening the differential diagnosis when the Meckel scan is negative to include other causes of lower GI bleeding in children.Suggested Reading Topics:- Pediatric Lower GI Bleeding (SCORE Curriculum)- Meckel\u2019s Diverticulum and Omphalomesenteric Duct Anomalies (ASE Core Curriculum)- Perioperative Management in Pediatric Surgery (ACS/ASE Review Manual)"
