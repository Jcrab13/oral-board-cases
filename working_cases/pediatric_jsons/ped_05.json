  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by promptly recognizing the classic presentation of pyloric stenosis. You appropriately prioritized resuscitation and electrolyte correction prior to surgery. Communication with the surgical team and parental counseling were clear and professional.Areas for Improvement:Earlier discussion of postoperative complications and counseling on prognosis would strengthen your performance. Be thorough in discharge planning, ensuring all aspects of care and parental concerns are addressed.Suggested Reading Topics: - SCORE Curriculum: Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis - ACS/ASE Review: Fluid and Electrolyte Management in Pediatrics - Operative Techniques in Pediatric Surgery: Ramstedt Pyloromyotomy"
