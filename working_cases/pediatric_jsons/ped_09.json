  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing necrotizing enterocolitis early and initiating appropriate medical management. Your clinical judgment in prioritizing bowel rest, decompression, and antibiotics was appropriate. Communication with the family was clear and empathetic.Areas for Improvement:Earlier emphasis on monitoring for perforation and escalation to surgical intervention would strengthen your management. Ensure consistent anticipation of complications and address nutritional strategies for long-term care.Suggested Reading Topics:- Necrotizing Enterocolitis (SCORE curriculum)- Sepsis and Source Control in Neonates (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Operative Management and Outcomes in Neonatal Intestinal Emergencies"
