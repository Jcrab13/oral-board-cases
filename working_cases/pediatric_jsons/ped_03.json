  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing congenital diaphragmatic hernia from exam and imaging findings. You appropriately prioritized airway management with intubation and NG decompression, and considered multidisciplinary consultation and ECMO in severe cases.Areas for Improvement: Work on articulating the timing of surgery and balancing stabilization versus urgent intervention. Expand postoperative planning, including long-term complications such as pulmonary hypertension and feeding challenges.Suggested Reading Topics: - Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia: Pathophysiology and Management (SCORE Curriculum) - Neonatal Airway and Ventilation Strategies (ACS/ASE Review Manual) - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Neonates (Pediatric Surgery NaT)"
