  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing bilious vomiting as a surgical emergency. Your resuscitation and timely decision to proceed with laparotomy were appropriate. You communicated clearly with the surgical team.Areas for Improvement:Further improvement includes articulating the operative steps of the Ladd\u2019s procedure in detail and addressing intraoperative decision-making when faced with necrotic bowel. Consider reinforcing postoperative care and long-term parental counseling.Suggested Reading:- SCORE Curriculum: Malrotation and Midgut Volvulus- Pediatric Surgery NaT: Neonatal Intestinal Obstruction- ACS/ASE Review Manual: Pediatric Surgical Emergencies"
