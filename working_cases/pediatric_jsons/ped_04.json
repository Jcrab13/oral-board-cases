  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing delayed meconium passage and proceeding to appropriate imaging and biopsy. Your operative planning reflected good understanding of pull-through procedures. Communication with the family and attention to long-term care were appropriate.Areas for Improvement:Earlier escalation when the infant deteriorated with enterocolitis would improve clinical urgency. You could also expand on postoperative complication management, such as strictures and recurrent enterocolitis.Suggested Reading:- SCORE: Hirschsprung\u2019s Disease and Anorectal Malformations- Pediatric Surgery NaT: Operative management of Hirschsprung\u2019s Disease- ACS/ASE Core Curriculum: Neonatal intestinal obstruction"
