  "resident_feedback_template": "StrengthsYou demonstrated solid diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the signs of diaphragmatic injury and appropriately ordering confirmatory imaging. Your surgical plan was logical and included safe operative principles. Communication with the team was clear and structured.Areas for ImprovementEarlier suspicion in polytrauma settings would strengthen your diagnostic reasoning. Greater emphasis on systematic evaluation for associated injuries (e.g., splenic or rib fractures) is needed. In postoperative care, consider highlighting pulmonary rehabilitation and long-term follow-up.Suggested Reading Topics- Traumatic Diaphragmatic Injuries (SCORE)- Operative Management of Thoracoabdominal Trauma (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Postoperative Pulmonary Complications and Management (SCORE)"
