  "setup_script": "\"You are called to the ICU to see a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, and known diverticulosis who was admitted 12 hours ago with abdominal pain. Despite IV antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, he has deteriorated. Current vital signs: Temperature 39.2\u00b0C, HR 128, BP 75/40, RR 28, O2 saturation 91% on 2L nasal cannula. Physical exam shows diffuse abdominal tenderness with involuntary guarding and rebound, worse in the left lower quadrant. Lab results show: WBC 22,000/\u03bcL, Hgb 10.5 g/dL, lactate 5.6 mmol/L, creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (baseline 1.0). Recent CT scan shows perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with free air and fluid collections in the pelvis. How would you manage this patient?\"",
