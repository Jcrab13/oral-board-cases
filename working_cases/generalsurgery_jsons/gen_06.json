  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated solid diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the incarcerated hernia and prioritizing timely surgical intervention. Your clinical judgment in preoperative preparation and antibiotic selection was appropriate. Communication of the operative plan was clear and structured.Areas for Improvement:Earlier escalation to surgery would have avoided progression to strangulation. Review the operative principles of bowel resection and the contraindications for mesh placement in contaminated fields.Suggested Reading Topics:- Management of Incarcerated and Strangulated Hernias (SCORE)- Principles of Emergency Bowel Resection (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Indications for Mesh Use in Hernia Surgery (SAGES Guidelines)"
