  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing small bowel obstruction early and initiating appropriate conservative management. Your communication of the management plan was clear and structured.Areas for Improvement: Earlier discussion of operative thresholds and explicit recognition of warning signs for strangulation would strengthen your clinical judgment. Providing more technical detail in operative description\u2014including adhesiolysis technique, bowel resection, anastomotic construction, and closure of mesenteric defects\u2014would enhance your surgical knowledge.Suggested Reading: - SCORE Curriculum: Small Bowel Obstruction - ACS/ASE Review: Management of Adhesive SBO - Operative Techniques in General Surgery: Adhesiolysis and Bowel Resection"
