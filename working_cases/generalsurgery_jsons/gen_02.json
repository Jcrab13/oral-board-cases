  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing bleeding gastric ulcer early and initiating appropriate resuscitation. You communicated your plan for urgent endoscopy clearly and prioritized stabilization.Areas for Improvement:Further improvement can be made in providing a detailed description of the operative steps during surgical management. Ensure you articulate technical details and postoperative considerations clearly.Suggested Reading Topics:- Upper GI Bleeding and Endoscopic Hemostasis (SCORE Curriculum)- Surgical Management of Peptic Ulcer Disease (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Technical Approaches to Oversewing Bleeding Ulcers and Vagotomy/Pyloroplasty (Surgical Textbook Reference)- H. pylori Testing and Eradication Guidelines (ACG Clinical Guideline)"
