  "resident_feedback_template": "StrengthsYou demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning in recognizing large bowel obstruction and appropriately pursuing confirmatory imaging. Your prioritization of resuscitation and decompression reflected sound clinical judgment. Communication of your management plan was structured and clear.Areas for ImprovementAt times, decisions around stenting versus immediate surgery could have been more clearly articulated, particularly in unstable patients. Earlier recognition of perforation risk and escalation to operative intervention would strengthen your management.Suggested Reading Topics- Management of Malignant Large Bowel Obstruction (SCORE)- Role of Stenting vs.\u00a0Surgery in Left-Sided Obstruction (NCCN Guidelines)- Surgical Approaches to Emergency Colectomy (ACS/ASE Review Manual)"
