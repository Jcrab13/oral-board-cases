  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing hiatal hernia with reflux disease and appropriately pursuing endoscopic and physiologic evaluation. Communication of management options, including surgical approaches, was clear and structured.Areas for Improvement: Earlier discussion of manometry findings and their implications for choice of fundoplication would improve surgical planning. More detailed description of the operative steps would strengthen your demonstration of surgical knowledge.Suggested Reading Topics: - SCORE Curriculum: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Hiatal Hernia - ACS/ASE Review Manual: Esophageal Surgery - Operative Approaches to Antireflux Surgery"
