  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated solid diagnostic reasoning by identifying the incisional hernia and appropriately considering repair versus observation. Your explanation of surgical options and postoperative precautions was clear and well-structured.Areas for Improvement:Earlier and more detailed discussion of risk factor modification, including smoking cessation and weight optimization, would strengthen your management plan. Expanding on patient education regarding recurrence and complications would further improve your communication.Suggested Reading:- SCORE Curriculum: Ventral and Incisional Hernias- ACS/ASE Review Manual: Abdominal Wall Hernias- Current guidelines on mesh use and minimally invasive hernia repair"
