  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated solid diagnostic reasoning by recognizing severe acute pancreatitis and applying scoring systems appropriately. Your prioritization of fluid resuscitation and ICU-level care was timely and appropriate. Communication of your management plan was clear and structured.Areas for Improvement:Earlier clarification of criteria for intervention in infected necrosis would strengthen your management approach. Avoiding premature antibiotic use and providing a clear, detailed operative description of necrosectomy would improve clinical judgment and surgical knowledge.Suggested Reading Topics:- SCORE: Acute Pancreatitis- ACS/ASE: Sepsis and Source Control- Operative Techniques in Pancreatic Necrosectomy and Postoperative Management"
