Your communication with the surgical team was clear and structured. You outlined operative steps in a logical manner.Areas for Improvement: Further detail in technical operative management, such as handling of a friable appendiceal base and postoperative complications, would strengthen your performance. Expand consideration of alternative diagnoses in the differential.Suggested Reading Topics: - SCORE: Appendicitis \u2013 diagnosis and management - ACS/ASE Review Manual: Acute Abdomen - Operative approaches to appendectomy (laparoscopic vs.\u00a0open) - Management of appendiceal stump and intraoperative complications"
