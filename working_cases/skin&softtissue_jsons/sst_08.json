  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated solid diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the features distinguishing lipoma from liposarcoma. Your management decisions regarding imaging and excision were well justified. Communication with the patient was clear and empathetic.Areas for Improvement: Earlier escalation to biopsy when malignant features arise would strengthen clinical judgment. At times, your counseling did not fully address the potential implications of a malignant diagnosis. Ensure you consistently provide comprehensive follow-up instructions.Suggested Reading Topics: - Evaluation and management of soft tissue masses (SCORE) - Differentiating benign from malignant soft tissue tumors (ACS/ASE Core Curriculum) - Principles of biopsy and surgical excision of soft tissue tumors"
