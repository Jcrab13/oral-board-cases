  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing Fournier\u2019s gangrene early. Your decision to initiate aggressive resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and timely surgical debridement reflects excellent clinical judgment. Communication of your management plan was clear and structured.Areas for Improvement:Consider earlier involvement of multidisciplinary teams such as plastic surgery and urology for staged reconstruction. More explicit planning for postoperative wound care and glycemic control could strengthen your management.Suggested Reading Topics:- Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections (SCORE)- Sepsis and Source Control (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Operative Management of Fournier\u2019s Gangrene"
