Your communication of the multidisciplinary plan was clear and well-organized.\u201dAreas for Improvement:\u201cConsider a more structured discussion of biopsy pitfalls and the limited role of radiation and chemotherapy in retroperitoneal sarcoma. Long-term surveillance and recurrence management should be more explicitly addressed.\u201dSuggested Reading Topics:- Retroperitoneal Sarcoma (SCORE Curriculum)- Principles of En Bloc Resection (NCCN Guidelines)- Surveillance and Recurrence in Retroperitoneal Sarcoma"
