Your communication of the surgical plan was clear and systematic.\u201dAreas for Improvement:\u201cConsider earlier integration of adjuvant therapy and long-term surveillance into your management plan. A more detailed discussion of recurrence management and evolving guideline changes for nodal disease would strengthen your performance.\u201dSuggested Reading Topics:- Surgical Management of Melanoma (SCORE Curriculum)- NCCN Guidelines for Melanoma- Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Adjuvant Therapy in Melanoma"
