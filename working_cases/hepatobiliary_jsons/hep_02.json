    "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing acute cholangitis using Charcot\u2019s triad and Reynolds pentad. You appropriately prioritized resuscitation and urgent biliary decompression. Communication of your management plan was structured and clear. Areas for Improvement:Consider discussing alternative decompression strategies more consistently (percutaneous drainage or surgical exploration) when ERCP is unavailable. Earlier anticipation of complications such as septic shock would further strengthen your clinical judgment.
