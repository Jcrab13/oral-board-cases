    "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing liver abscess early and pursuing appropriate imaging. You prioritized empiric antibiotics and drainage appropriately. Communication with the care team was clear and structured. Areas for Improvement:Earlier evaluation for potential sources of infection would have strengthened your approach. Timely escalation when the patient deteriorated could have been more immediate. Review the criteria for when antibiotics alone may suffice versus when drainage is required.
