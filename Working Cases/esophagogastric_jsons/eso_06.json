  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the need for biopsy and staging with CT/EUS. Your surgical plan reflected an understanding of subtotal gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy. Communication of your treatment sequence was clear and organized.Areas for Improvement:Consider strengthening the urgency and sequencing of perioperative chemotherapy and surgery. More detail regarding postoperative nutritional management and long-term surveillance would improve completeness.Suggested Reading:- Gastric Cancer: NCCN Guidelines- SCORE: Gastric Cancer Management- Perioperative Chemotherapy in GI Malignancy (FLOT regimen evidence)"
