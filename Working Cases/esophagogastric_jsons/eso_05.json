  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing esophageal perforation early and appropriately obtaining confirmatory imaging. Your clinical judgment in initiating resuscitation, antibiotics, and urgent surgical consultation was appropriate. Communication with the care team was clear and organized.Areas for Improvement: Consider more explicit discussion of criteria for nonoperative versus operative management in esophageal perforation. In addition, surgical exposure and repair techniques should be described in more detail to demonstrate technical readiness.Suggested Reading Topics: - Esophageal perforation and Boerhaave\u2019s syndrome (SCORE) - Principles of mediastinal drainage and infection control (ACS/ASE Review Manual) - Operative approaches to esophageal repair, thoracotomy exposure, and postoperative care"
