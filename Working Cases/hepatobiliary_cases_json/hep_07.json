You appropriately utilized imaging and ERCP for diagnosis and treatment, and your management plan incorporated multidisciplinary care. Areas for ImprovementYou should further refine your discussion of the mechanisms of bile leak and expand on long-term monitoring and stent management. Clarifying your sequence of interventions in unstable patients would improve your clinical judgment.
