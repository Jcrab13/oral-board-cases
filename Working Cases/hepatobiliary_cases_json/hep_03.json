    "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning in recognizing choledocholithiasis and selecting appropriate diagnostic imaging. Your sequencing of ERCP followed by cholecystectomy showed good clinical judgment. Communication of your management plan was clear and structured. Areas for Improvement: Earlier articulation of the risks of delayed ERCP and potential complications would improve your performance. Additionally, expanding on the role of intraoperative cholangiography in preventing retained stones and providing a complete, stepwise description of laparoscopic cholecystectomy technique would strengthen your surgical knowledge.
