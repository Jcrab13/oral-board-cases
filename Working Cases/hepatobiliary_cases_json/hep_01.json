    "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by identifying acute cholecystitis and recognizing the need for surgical intervention. You communicated the management plan clearly and appropriately initiated resuscitation and antibiotics. Areas for Improvement:Work on clearly articulating the indications for percutaneous cholecystostomy in high-risk or unstable patients. Also ensure timely transition from diagnosis to definitive surgical management without unnecessary delays. Be prepared to describe operative steps of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in detail when asked.
