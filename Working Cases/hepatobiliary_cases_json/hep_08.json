    "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing PSC using both laboratory and imaging findings. You appropriately emphasized long-term surveillance and identified the importance of colonoscopy in the setting of ulcerative colitis. Communication of your plan was clear and structured. Areas for Improvement: Earlier recognition of the role of cholangiocarcinoma screening and the specific criteria for liver transplantation would improve your management approach. Greater emphasis on patient counseling regarding lifestyle modifications and hepatotoxin avoidance is recommended.
