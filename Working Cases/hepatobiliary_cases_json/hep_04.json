    "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by promptly identifying gallstone pancreatitis and initiating appropriate resuscitation. Your plan for early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the index admission was appropriate. Communication of your management approach was clear and organized. Areas for Improvement: Further clarity is needed in distinguishing which patients require urgent ERCP. Ensure dietary advancement is based on clinical recovery rather than timing alone. Review the role of antibiotics and avoid unnecessary use unless infection is documented. Provide more detail when describing the operative steps of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
