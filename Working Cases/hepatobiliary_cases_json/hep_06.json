    "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by appropriately interpreting the incidental cancer finding and pursuing staging workup. Your recognition of the need for extended resection showed solid clinical judgment. Areas for Improvement:Earlier discussion of the importance of timing for reoperation would strengthen your management plan. Consider being more structured when outlining surveillance and adjuvant therapy recommendations.
