  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated solid diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the infection early. Your decision to open and drain the wound with appropriate cultures showed sound judgment. Communication with the team and patient was clear and organized.Areas for Improvement:Earlier initiation of antibiotics and more comprehensive patient education would strengthen your management. Ensure you consistently evaluate for deeper sources, such as an anastomotic leak, when infections progress despite initial intervention.Suggested Reading Topics:- Surgical Site Infections (SCORE)- Principles of Wound Management and Negative Pressure Therapy (ACS/ASE Manual)- Anastomotic Leak Recognition and Management"
