  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated solid diagnostic reasoning by recognizing melanoma as a likely diagnosis and ordering the correct biopsy. Your explanation of surgical margins and the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy was clear and well-structured. Communication with the patient about diagnosis and follow-up was empathetic and organized.Areas for Improvement: Earlier recognition of the need for sentinel node biopsy and clear articulation of its indications would strengthen your management plan. You could also improve by integrating discussion of adjuvant immunotherapy and surveillance into your primary plan without prompting.Suggested Reading Topics: - NCCN Guidelines on Melanoma - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Melanoma (SCORE Curriculum) - Principles of Wide Local Excision and Surgical Margins in Melanoma"
