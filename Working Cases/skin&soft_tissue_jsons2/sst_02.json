She reports severe pain that she describes as much worse than the appearance of the skin would suggest. She has had fevers and malaise over the past day. On exam, the erythematous area extends broadly across the anterior thigh and is exquisitely tender to palpation. How would you proceed with this patient?\u201d",

  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the features concerning for necrotizing fasciitis. Your communication of the plan was clear and well-structured, and you prioritized surgical consultation appropriately.Areas for Improvement: Earlier recognition of rapid progression and disproportionate pain could have improved urgency in decision-making. A more detailed description of the operative technique would strengthen your surgical knowledge and management approach.Suggested Reading: - Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections (SCORE) - Sepsis and Source Control (ACS/ASE Review Manual) - Principles of Surgical Infection Management (ASE Core Curriculum)"
