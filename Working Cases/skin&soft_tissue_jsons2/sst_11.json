He reports the symptoms began 24 hours ago but have worsened dramatically in the past 6 hours. He is febrile to 39.5\u00b0C, tachycardic to 135 bpm, hypotensive at 85/50 mmHg, and tachypneic at 28/min. On exam, his right thigh is erythematous with tense swelling, violaceous discoloration, crepitus, and exquisite tenderness out of proportion to exam. What would you like to do next?\u201d",

Your communication of the resuscitation and operative plan was clear and well-structured.\u201dAreas for Improvement:\u201cConsider a more detailed discussion of postoperative critical care needs and the importance of planned re-explorations. Earlier recognition of the potential need for amputation in uncontrolled infection would further strengthen your management plan.\u201dSuggested Reading Topics:- Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections (SCORE Curriculum)- Sepsis and Source Control (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Principles of Surgical Debridement and Reconstruction"
