  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the characteristic features of basal cell carcinoma and confirming the diagnosis with biopsy. You appropriately discussed surgical management options and emphasized the role of Mohs surgery for cosmetically sensitive areas.Areas for Improvement: Earlier recognition of the importance of timely biopsy and more detailed explanation of recurrence risks and histologic subtypes would strengthen your management. Comprehensive counseling on sun protection and secondary lesion screening should be consistently included.Suggested Reading Topics: - SCORE: Non-melanoma Skin Cancer - American Cancer Society: Surgical Management of Basal Cell Carcinoma - ACS/ASE Review Manual: Principles of Skin Cancer Excision and Mohs Surgery"
