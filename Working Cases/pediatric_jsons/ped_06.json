  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the classic features of intussusception and appropriately ordering confirmatory imaging. Your management prioritized resuscitation and timely enema reduction. Communication with the family was clear and empathetic.Areas for Improvement: Consider refining the sequence of stabilization and diagnosis to minimize delays. Review the operative management, including technical steps of manual reduction and inspection for lead points. Continue developing efficiency in articulating recurrence risk and post-reduction care.Suggested Reading Topics: - SCORE: Intussusception in Infants and Children - Pediatric bowel obstruction and management strategies - Operative and nonoperative management of intussusception"
