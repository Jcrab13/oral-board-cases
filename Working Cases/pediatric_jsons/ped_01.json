You clearly outlined a management plan and included multidisciplinary coordination. Communication of parental counseling was structured and empathetic.Areas for Improvement Consider refining your explanation of long-term bowel management and functional outcomes. Earlier discussion of complications such as strictures and soiling would strengthen your management plan.Suggested Reading Topics - SCORE Curriculum: Anorectal Malformations in Neonates - Pediatric Surgery NaT: Management of Imperforate Anus - Long-term Outcomes after Posterior Sagittal Anorectoplasty"
