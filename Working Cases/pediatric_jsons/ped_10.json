  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by promptly recognizing appendicitis. You prioritized resuscitation, antibiotics, and surgical consultation effectively. Communication with the patient\u2019s family was clear and compassionate.Areas for Improvement: Consider refining decision-making around non-operative management, including discussing recurrence risk. Earlier recognition and intervention in the setting of worsening vitals would improve timeliness of care. Expand discussion of postoperative complications and ensure thorough description of operative techniques.Suggested Reading Topics: - Pediatric Appendicitis (SCORE curriculum) - Non-operative Management of Appendicitis in Children (ASE Core Curriculum) - Operative Techniques in Pediatric Appendectomy - Postoperative Care and Complications in Pediatric Surgery"
