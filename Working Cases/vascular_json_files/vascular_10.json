She has a history of longstanding varicose veins and works in an occupation that requires prolonged standing. She reports leg swelling and heaviness by the end of the day. On exam, you notice venous stasis changes around the ankle. How would you proceed?",

You appropriately initiated compression therapy and wound care. Communication of your plan was clear and patient-centered.. Areas for improvement include Earlier recognition and treatment of infection would improve outcomes. Further refinement is needed in determining when to recommend surgical or endovenous interventions following ulcer healing..
