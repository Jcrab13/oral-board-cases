Your communication was structured and clear when discussing operative planning and perioperative risks.. Areas for improvement include Earlier initiation of medical therapy and timely referral could have been emphasized more strongly. A more detailed step-by-step description of the carotid endarterectomy technique, including plaque removal and patch closure, would further demonstrate surgical mastery..
