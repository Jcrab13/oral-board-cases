Your management plan included initiation of medical therapy and revascularization options. You demonstrated clear communication of findings and management priorities.. Areas for improvement include Earlier recognition of the need for urgent revascularization could have improved patient outcomes. A more detailed operative description would strengthen your performance, including exposure, conduit selection, anastomotic technique, and intraoperative flow assessment. Avoid reliance on conservative measures alone in patients with tissue loss..
