Your decision to proceed with operative management showed sound clinical judgment. Communication with the team was clear and structured.\nAreas for Improvement:Earlier prioritization of operative intervention without delay for CT imaging would have optimized care. Postoperative considerations such as nutritional support and staged abdominal closure should be more thoroughly discussed.\nSuggested Reading Topics:- Management of Penetrating Abdominal Trauma (SCORE)- ATLS Principles: Hemodynamic Instability in Trauma (ACS)- Damage Control Surgery and Open Abdomen Management (ASE Core Curriculum)"
