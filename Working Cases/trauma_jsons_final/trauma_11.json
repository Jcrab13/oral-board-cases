  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the pelvic fracture as a source of life-threatening hemorrhage. You appropriately applied a binder and activated the massive transfusion protocol. Your sequencing of interventions showed sound prioritization.\nAreas for Improvement:At times, decisions regarding when to escalate to angiography or external fixation could have been more clearly articulated. Continue working on integrating multidisciplinary coordination with trauma, orthopedic, and interventional teams in real time.\nSuggested Reading Topics:- Management of Unstable Pelvic Fractures (EAST Guidelines)- Massive Transfusion Protocols in Trauma (ACS Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient)- Operative and Non-Operative Management of Pelvic Ring Injuries (SCORE Curriculum)"
