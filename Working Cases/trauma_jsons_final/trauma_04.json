  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You promptly recognized obstructive shock and used the FAST exam appropriately. Your ability to initiate temporizing measures and progress to definitive operative management was appropriate. You described key operative steps in cardiac repair clearly.\nAreas for Improvement:In future, ensure that you consistently outline the complete sequence of operative management, including exposure, bleeding control, and repair technique. Earlier discussion of ED thoracotomy indications would also strengthen your performance.\nSuggested Reading Topics:- Operative Repair of Penetrating Cardiac Trauma (SCORE)- Techniques in Cardiac Injury Management (ACS/ASE Trauma Manual)- Emergency Department Thoracotomy: Indications and Outcomes (EAST Guidelines)"
