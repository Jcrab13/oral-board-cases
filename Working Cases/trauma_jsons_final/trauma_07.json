  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the implications of a Zone II penetrating neck injury. Your airway management preparation was appropriate, and you effectively incorporated imaging and surgical decision-making. Communication of your plan was clear and confident.\nAreas for Improvement: Earlier recognition of the potential for rapid airway compromise would improve clinical urgency. Incorporation of structured postoperative surveillance, including vocal cord evaluation, would strengthen your management.\nSuggested Reading Topics: - Penetrating Neck Trauma (SCORE) - Airway Management in Trauma (ACS/ASE Review Manual) - Selective vs.\u00a0Mandatory Exploration in Neck Injuries"
