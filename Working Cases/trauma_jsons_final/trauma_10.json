  "resident_feedback_template": "StrengthsYou demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by promptly recognizing the need for airway protection and fluid resuscitation. Your clinical judgment in addressing inhalation injury and initiating transfer to a burn center showed good prioritization. Communication of your plan was clear and structured.\nAreas for ImprovementEarlier recognition and decisive management of the airway would improve outcomes in burn patients with inhalation injury. Consider reinforcing knowledge on monitoring adequacy of resuscitation and recognizing when escharotomy is required.\nSuggested Reading Topics- Inhalation Injury and Airway Management (SCORE)- Parkland Formula and Burn Resuscitation (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Escharotomy Indications and Technique (SCORE Curriculum)"
