  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the clinical features of compartment syndrome. You communicated your plan clearly and appropriately escalated care with orthopedic consultation. Your operative description showed solid understanding of fasciotomy principles.\nAreas for Improvement: Earlier recognition and measurement of compartment pressures would have strengthened your clinical judgment. Ensure that you always discuss the risk of delays in diagnosis and the potential for long-term disability.\nSuggested Reading: - SCORE Curriculum: Compartment Syndrome and Fasciotomy - ACS/ASE Review Manual: Extremity Trauma - Orthopedic Trauma Association: Principles of Compartment Syndrome Management"
