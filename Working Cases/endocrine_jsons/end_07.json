  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing pheochromocytoma based on classic clinical features and confirming with biochemical testing. You showed good judgment by discussing appropriate preoperative alpha blockade and intraoperative collaboration with anesthesia. Communication of your management plan was structured and clear.Areas for Improvement: Further detail regarding the technical steps of adrenalectomy, particularly early adrenal vein control, would strengthen your surgical knowledge. Earlier emphasis on lifelong surveillance and family screening in MEN 2A would also improve your management.Suggested Reading Topics: - Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (SCORE Curriculum) - Preoperative Management of Endocrine Tumors (ACS/ASE Review Manual) - MEN 2 Syndromes and Surveillance Guidelines (NCCN/Endocrine Society) - Operative Techniques in Adrenalectomy"
