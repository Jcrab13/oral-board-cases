  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the potential airway emergency. Your communication with the anesthesia and ENT teams was clear and collaborative, and you appropriately disclosed the complication to the patient and family.Areas for Improvement:Consider earlier escalation to airway intervention in cases of stridor to avoid deterioration. Ensure consistent evaluation for reversible causes such as hematoma. Expand counseling to include long-term expectations for recovery and possible interventions.Suggested Reading Topics:- Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury After Thyroidectomy (SCORE)- Airway Emergencies in Postoperative Patients (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Surgical and Non-Surgical Management of Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis"
