  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing airway compression and planning surgery appropriately. Your surgical plan showed good knowledge of thyroidectomy indications and steps. Communication with the anesthesia team and emphasis on airway management was clear.Areas for Improvement: Earlier recognition of the urgency of airway compromise could be improved. Greater detail in postoperative monitoring and calcium management is recommended. Reinforce knowledge of emergent management of neck hematoma.Suggested Reading Topics: - SCORE Curriculum: Thyroid Disease and Surgery - Airway Management in Large Goiters (ASA Guidelines) - Postoperative Complications of Thyroid Surgery (hypocalcemia, hematoma, RLN injury)"
