  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths: You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the hereditary nature of medullary thyroid carcinoma and incorporating MEN 2 evaluation. You communicated your surgical plan clearly and showed good understanding of the operative and postoperative considerations.Areas for Improvement: Earlier recognition of the importance of pheochromocytoma screening would improve patient safety. Consider strengthening your approach to nodal management in medullary thyroid carcinoma and expanding discussion of long-term genetic counseling implications.Suggested Reading Topics: - SCORE Curriculum: Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma - ACS/ASE Review Manual: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes - ATA Guidelines on Management of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma"
