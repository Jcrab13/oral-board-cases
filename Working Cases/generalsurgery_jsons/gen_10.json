  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by rapidly identifying perforated peptic ulcer based on history, exam, and imaging. Your prioritization of resuscitation and surgical intervention showed good clinical judgment. Communication of your management plan was structured and clear.Areas for Improvement:A more detailed description of operative steps, including omental patch technique, would strengthen your performance. Earlier discussion of postoperative management, including H. pylori testing and ulcer prevention strategies, would also enhance your care plan.Suggested Reading:- SCORE Curriculum: Peptic Ulcer Disease- ACS/ASE Review Manual: Perforated Viscus- Graham Patch Repair and Operative Management of Peptic Ulcer Disease"
