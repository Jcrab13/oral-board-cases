  "resident_feedback_template": "Strengths:You demonstrated strong diagnostic reasoning by recognizing the high-output enterocutaneous fistula promptly. Your management of sepsis and initiation of nutritional optimization were appropriate. Communication with the patient and interdisciplinary team was clear and compassionate.Areas for Improvement:Earlier emphasis on evaluating distal obstruction and establishing criteria for surgical timing would strengthen your clinical judgment. Consider reinforcing the indications for delayed versus early operative management.Suggested Reading Topics:- SCORE: Enterocutaneous Fistulas- Sepsis and Source Control (ACS/ASE Review Manual)- Nutritional Optimization in Surgical Patients"
